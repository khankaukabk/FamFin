            "BOOK THE FIRST: POVERTY",
            "CHAPTER 1. Sun and Shadow",
            "Thirty years ago, on a specific day, Marseilles was absolutely baking in the sun.",
            "A scorching sun on a fierce August day wasn't any rarer in southern France back then than it is now.",
            "Everything in and around Marseilles stared up at the boiling sky, and the sky stared right back, until staring became a universal habit there.",
            "Visitors felt awkward getting stared down by the blinding white houses, the white walls, the white streets, the dry stretches of road, and the hills where all the greenery had been burnt away.",
            "The only things that weren't staring intensely were the vines, drooping under the weight of their grapes. Even they winked a little now and then, whenever the hot air barely moved their leaves.",
            "There wasn't a breath of wind to cause a ripple on the dirty water in the harbour, or on the beautiful sea outside it.",
            "You could see a clear line between the two colours, black and blue, showing exactly where the clean sea stopped; it refused to mix with the filthy harbour water.",
            "Boats without covers were too hot to touch; ships blistered where they were tied up; the stone quays hadn't cooled down, day or night, for months.",
            "People from all over—Hindus, Russians, Chinese, Spaniards, Portuguese, Englishmen, Frenchmen, Genoese, Neapolitans, Venetians, Greeks, Turks—everyone who had come to trade in Marseilles sought shade.",
            "They hid anywhere they could from a sea that was too blue to look at and a purple sky that looked like it held a massive, flaming jewel of fire.",
            "The glare everywhere made your eyes ache. Looking towards the distant Italian coast, there was a bit of relief thanks to some light mist rising from the sea, but that was it.",
            "Far away, the dusty roads stared from the hillsides and hollows.",
            "Far away, the dusty vines hanging over cottages and the rows of dry trees offered no shade, drooping under the glare of the earth and sky.",
            "The horses with their drowsy bells, pulling carts slowly inland, did the same; so did the drivers lying down in the carts, mostly asleep; so did the exhausted farm workers.",
            "Everything living or growing was crushed by the glare, except for the lizards darting over stone walls, and the cicadas, chirping their dry, hot sound like a rattle.",
            "Even the dust was scorched brown, and the air shimmered as if it were panting.",
            "Blinds, shutters, curtains, and awnings were all shut tight to keep out the glare. If you left even a tiny crack, the sun shot in like a white-hot arrow.",
            "The churches were the best escape.",
            "Coming out of the dark, cool pillars and arches—dotted with flickering candles and full of ugly old shadows praying, spitting, and begging—felt like diving into a river of fire and swimming for your life to the nearest bit of shade.",
            "So, with people lounging wherever there was shade, with hardly any talking or dogs barking, just the occasional clashing of church bells and drumming, Marseilles was broiling in the sun that day.",
            "In Marseilles at that time, there was a nasty prison.",
            "In one of its cells—a place so repulsive that even the sun seemed to blink and look away, leaving it to whatever reflected light could find its way in—were two men.",
            "Besides them, the room held a battered bench stuck to the wall, a draughts board roughly carved into it with a knife, a set of draughts made from old buttons and soup bones, a set of dominoes, two mats, and two or three wine bottles.",
            "That was it, apart from the rats and other hidden vermin, and the visible vermin: the two men.",
            "The cell got its light through a large iron grate, like a window, which allowed it to be inspected from the gloomy staircase outside.",
            "There was a broad stone ledge at the bottom of this grate, three or four feet off the ground.",
            "One of the men was lolling on this ledge, half-sitting and half-lying, with his knees up and his feet and shoulders pressed against the sides of the opening.",
            "The bars were wide enough for him to stick his arm through up to the elbow, so he held on casually to make himself comfortable.",
            "The smell of prison was on everything. The trapped air, the trapped light, the trapped damp, the trapped men—everything was ruined by the confinement.",
            "Just as the men looked faded and haggard, the iron was rusty, the stone was slimy, the wood was rotten, the air felt stale, and the light was dim.",
            "Like a well, a vault, or a tomb, the prison knew nothing of the brightness outside. It would have kept its polluted atmosphere even if you moved it to a tropical island.",
            "The man lying on the window ledge actually felt chilly. He pulled his big cloak tighter with an impatient shrug and growled, 'To hell with this Brigand of a Sun that never shines in here!'",
            "He was waiting to be fed, looking sideways through the bars to see down the stairs, looking a lot like a wild beast waiting for food.",
            "But his eyes, set too close together, weren't as noble as a lion's; they were sharp rather than bright—like pointed weapons with no depth. They glittered and snapped open and shut. A clockmaker could have made a better pair.",
            "He had a hook nose, which was handsome enough, but it was too high up between his eyes, just like his eyes were too close together.",
            "He was a big, tall man with thin lips (when you could see them under his thick moustache) and messy, dry hair of no specific colour, though it had streaks of red.",
            "The hand holding the grate—covered in ugly, freshly healed scratches—was unusually small and plump; it would have been white if not for the prison dirt.",
            "The other man was lying on the stone floor, covered by a rough brown coat.",
            "'Get up, pig!' growled the first man. 'Don't sleep when I'm hungry.'",
            "'It's all the same, master,' said the 'pig', submissively but cheerfully. 'I can wake when I want, I can sleep when I want. It makes no difference.'",
            "As he said this, he got up, shook himself, scratched, tied his brown coat loosely around his neck by the sleeves (he'd been using it as a blanket), and sat on the floor yawning, leaning his back against the wall opposite the grate.",
            "'Tell me the time,' grumbled the first man.",
            "'The midday bells will ring... in forty minutes.' He paused slightly, looking around the cell as if reading the information from the walls.",
            "'You're like a clock. How do you always know?'",
            "'How can I say? I always know the time and where I am. I was brought here at night, straight off a boat, but I know where I am. Look here! Marseilles harbour,' he said, drawing a map on the floor with a dark finger.",
            "'Toulon (where the galleys are), Spain over there, Algiers over there. Moving left, Nice. Round the coast to Genoa. Genoa Mole and Harbour. Quarantine Ground. The City; terrace gardens full of bella donna flowers. Here, Porto Fino. Head out for Leghorn. Out again for Civita Vecchia, then away to—hey! There's no room for Naples,' he'd reached the wall by then, 'but it's all the same; it's in there!'",
            "He stayed on his knees, looking up at his cellmate with a lively expression for someone in prison.",
            "He was a sunburnt, quick, agile little man, though a bit stocky. He had earrings in his brown ears, white teeth that lit up his funny brown face, jet-black hair around his brown neck, and a ragged red shirt open at his chest.",
            "He wore loose sailor trousers, decent shoes, a long red cap, and a red sash around his waist with a knife tucked in it.",
            "'Just watch if I don't go back to Naples the same way I came! Look here, master! Civita Vecchia, Leghorn, Porto Fino, Genoa, the Coast, Off Nice (which is in there), Marseilles, you and me.'",
            "'The jailer's room and his keys are where my thumb is; and here at my wrist is where they keep the national razor—the guillotine.'",
            "The other man suddenly spat on the floor and made a gurgling noise in his throat.",
            "Immediately after, a lock below gurgled too, and a door banged shut. Slow footsteps started coming up the stairs; the sound of a sweet little voice mixed with the noise. The jailer appeared carrying his daughter, who was three or four years old, and a basket.",
            "'How's the world this morning, gentlemen? My little one is doing the rounds with me to peek at her father's birds. Go on then! Look at the birds, my pretty, look at the birds.'",
            "He looked sharply at the 'birds' himself as he held the child up to the grate, especially eyeing the little man, whose energy he seemed to mistrust.",
            "'I've brought your bread, Signor John Baptist,' he said (they spoke in French, but the little man was Italian). 'And if I might recommend you stop gambling—'",
            "'You don't recommend the master stop!' said John Baptist, smiling and showing his teeth.",
            "'Oh! But the master wins,' the jailer replied, giving the other man a look that wasn't particularly friendly. 'And you lose. It's totally different. You get stale bread and sour drink out of it; he gets Lyons sausage, veal in jelly, white bread, Stracchino cheese, and good wine. Look at the birds, my pretty!'",
            "'Poor birds!' said the child.",
            "Her pretty little face, full of pure compassion as she peeked shyly through the bars, looked like an angel in that prison. John Baptist stood up and moved towards her, as if drawn to her. The other 'bird' stayed where he was, just glancing impatiently at the basket.",
            "'Wait!' said the jailer, putting his daughter on the outer ledge. 'She can feed the birds.'",
            "'This big loaf is for Signor John Baptist. We have to break it to fit it through the cage. There, a tame bird to kiss your little hand!'",
            "'This sausage in a vine leaf is for Monsieur Rigaud. Again—this veal in jelly is for Monsieur Rigaud. Again—these three white rolls are for Monsieur Rigaud. Again, this cheese—again, this wine—again, this tobacco—all for Monsieur Rigaud. Lucky bird!'",
            "The child pushed all these things through the bars into the soft, smooth hand with clear fear—pulling her own hand back more than once and looking at the man with a mix of fright and anger.",
            "However, she handed the lump of coarse bread to the dark, rough, knotted hands of John Baptist (who had fewer fingernails on all his fingers combined than Monsieur Rigaud had on one) with total confidence; and when he kissed her hand, she stroked his face affectionately.",
            "Monsieur Rigaud, not caring about this, kept the father happy by laughing and nodding at the girl whenever she gave him something. As soon as he had his food arranged on the ledge, he started eating with gusto.",
            "When Monsieur Rigaud laughed, his face changed in a way that was striking but not nice. His moustache went up under his nose, and his nose came down over his moustache, making him look sinister and cruel.",
            "'There!' said the jailer, tipping his basket upside down to empty the crumbs. 'I've spent all the money I was given; here's the receipt, job done. Monsieur Rigaud, as I expected yesterday, the President wants the pleasure of your company an hour after midday today.'",
            "'To try me, eh?' said Rigaud, pausing with his knife in hand and food in his mouth.",
            "'You said it. To put you on trial.'",
            "'No news for me?' asked John Baptist, who had started munching his bread contentedly.",
            "The jailer shrugged.",
            "'My Lady! Am I going to rot here all my life, father?'",
            "'What do I know!' cried the jailer, turning on him with southern intensity, waving his hands as if threatening to tear him apart. 'My friend, how can I possibly tell how long you'll be here? What do I know, John Baptist Cavalletto? For the life of me! There are prisoners here sometimes who aren't in such a devil of a rush to be tried.'",
            "He seemed to glance sideways at Monsieur Rigaud with this remark; but Rigaud had gone back to his meal, though perhaps eating a bit slower than before.",
            "'Goodbye, my birds!' said the jailer, picking up his pretty child and prompting her to say it with a kiss.",
            "'Goodbye, my birds!' the child repeated.",
            "Her innocent face looked back so brightly over his shoulder as he walked away, singing her a nursery rhyme:\n\n'Who passes by this road so late?\nCompagnon de la Majolaine!\nWho passes by this road so late?\nAlways gay!'",
            "John Baptist felt honour-bound to reply through the grate, in time and tune, though his voice was a bit rough:\n\n'Of all the king's knights 'tis the flower,\nCompagnon de la Majolaine!\nOf all the king's knights 'tis the flower,\nAlways gay!'",
            "This duet followed them down the steep stairs so far that the jailer had to stop to let his daughter hear the end of the song and repeat the chorus while they were still visible. Then they disappeared, but the little voice kept singing until the door slammed shut.",
            "Monsieur Rigaud, finding John Baptist standing in his way before the echoes died out (even echoes were weak in prison), nudged him with his foot to remind him to get back to his dark corner.",
            "The little man sat down again on the floor with the ease of someone used to sitting on pavements. He lined up three chunks of coarse bread and, starting on a fourth, began eating them as if clearing them away was a game.",
            "He might have glanced at the Lyons sausage or the veal in jelly, but they didn't last long enough to make his mouth water; Monsieur Rigaud finished them off quickly, despite the looming trial, and sucked his fingers clean, wiping them on the vine leaves.",
            "Then, pausing his drinking to look at his cellmate, his moustache went up and his nose came down.",
            "'How's the bread?'",
            "'A bit dry, but I've got my old sauce here,' replied John Baptist, holding up his knife.",
            "'What sauce?'",
            "'I can cut my bread like this—like a melon. Or like this—like an omelette. Or like this—like a fried fish. Or like this—like Lyons sausage,' said John Baptist, acting out the cuts on his bread and chewing soberly.",
            "'Here!' cried Monsieur Rigaud. 'Have a drink. You can finish this.'",
            "It wasn't a huge gift, as there was hardly any wine left; but Signor Cavalletto jumped up, took the bottle gratefully, tipped it up, and smacked his lips.",
            "'Put the bottle with the others,' said Rigaud.",
            "The little man obeyed and stood ready to give him a light; Rigaud was rolling a cigarette using little squares of paper that came with the tobacco.",
            "'Here! You can have one.'",
            "'A thousand thanks, master!' John Baptist said in Italian, with the quick, polite manner of his people.",
            "Monsieur Rigaud stood up, lit a cigarette, put the rest in his pocket, and stretched out on the bench. Cavalletto sat on the floor, holding his ankles, smoking peacefully.",
            "Monsieur Rigaud's eyes seemed uncomfortably drawn to the spot on the floor where John Baptist had put his thumb on the imaginary map earlier. He looked there so often that the Italian noticed and looked back and forth in surprise.",
            "'What a hellhole this is!' said Monsieur Rigaud, breaking the silence. 'Look at the daylight. Day? It looks like last week's light, or light from six months ago—six years ago. So weak and dead!'",
            "The light drifted down a square shaft that blocked a window on the stairs, so you could never see the sky—or anything else.",
            "'Cavalletto,' said Monsieur Rigaud, suddenly looking away from the shaft they were both staring at, 'you know I'm a gentleman, right?'",
            "'Definitely, definitely!'",
            "'How long have we been here?'",
            "'Me, eleven weeks at midnight tomorrow. You, nine weeks and three days at five this afternoon.'",
            "'Have I ever done anything here? Ever touched the broom, spread the mats, rolled them up, found the draughts pieces, collected the dominoes, or done any work at all?'",
            "'Never!'",
            "'Have you ever expected me to do any work?'",
            "John Baptist answered with that specific shake of the right forefinger that means a strong 'no' in Italian.",
            "'No! You knew from the moment you saw me that I was a gentleman?'",
            "'Altro!' replied John Baptist, closing his eyes and tossing his head. This word, which can mean yes, no, maybe, a joke, or a hundred other things depending on the tone, in this context meant a very strong 'I believe you!' or 'Too right!'",
            "'Haha! You're right! I am a gentleman! And I'll live like a gentleman and die like a gentleman! It's my plan to be a gentleman. That's my game. I'll play it out wherever I go!'",
            "He sat up, shouting triumphantly: 'Here I am! Look at me! Thrown by destiny into a cell with a mere smuggler; locked up with a poor little illegal trader whose papers are wrong, and who the police grabbed for lending his boat to other people whose papers were wrong. And yet, he instinctively recognises my status, even in this dark place. Well done! By Heaven! I win, no matter how the game goes.'",
            "Again, his moustache went up and his nose came down.",
            "'What time is it now?' he asked, looking pale and sweaty in a way that didn't match his laughter.",
            "'Just past half-twelve.'",
            "'Good! The President will have a gentleman in front of him soon. Come on! Shall I tell you what I'm accused of? It's now or never, because I won't be coming back here. Either I walk free, or I go to get ready for a shave. You know where they keep the razor.'",
            "Signor Cavalletto took the cigarette out of his mouth and looked more worried than you'd expect.",
            "'I am a'—Monsieur Rigaud stood up to say it—'I am a cosmopolitan gentleman. I don't belong to any specific country. My father was Swiss. My mother was French by blood, English by birth. I was born in Belgium. I'm a citizen of the world.'",
            "His dramatic pose, with one hand on his hip inside his cloak, and the way he spoke to the wall instead of his cellmate, suggested he was rehearsing for the President rather than just talking to little John Baptist Cavalletto.",
            "'Let's say I'm thirty-five. I've seen the world. I've lived here, there, everywhere—and always like a gentleman. I've been treated and respected as a gentleman everywhere. If you try to make me look bad by saying I've lived by my wits—well, how do your lawyers live? Your politicians? Your schemers? Your stockbrokers?'",
            "He kept waving his small, smooth hand around, as if it was proof of his high status.",
            "'Two years ago I came to Marseilles. I admit I was poor; I'd been ill. When your lawyers, politicians, and stockbrokers get ill and haven't saved money, they get poor too. I stayed at the Cross of Gold hotel—run by Monsieur Henri Barronneau—who was sixty-five and failing in health. I'd lived there about four months when Monsieur Barronneau had the misfortune to die. Not exactly a rare misfortune, that. It happens often enough without my help.'",
            "John Baptist had smoked his cigarette down to his fingertips, so Monsieur Rigaud generously threw him another one. He lit the second one from the ash of the first and kept smoking, looking sideways at Rigaud, who was too focused on his own story to notice.",
            "'Monsieur Barronneau left a widow. She was twenty-two. She had a reputation for being beautiful, and (which is often a different thing) actually was beautiful. I stayed at the Cross of Gold. I married Madame Barronneau. It's not for me to say if there was a big difference in class. Here I stand, covered in prison filth; but you might think I was a better match for her than her first husband.'",
            "He had a certain air of being a handsome man—which he wasn't; and a certain air of being a well-bred man—which he wasn't. It was just swagger and attitude; but in this world, confident bluffing often passes for proof.",
            "'Anyway, Madame Barronneau approved of me. That shouldn't work against me, I hope?'",
            "His eye fell on John Baptist, who quickly shook his head 'no' and whispered altro, altro, altro a bunch of times.",
            "'Now came the problems. I am proud. I'm not saying pride is good, but I am proud. It's also in my nature to be in charge. I can't submit; I have to lead. Unfortunately, Madame Rigaud's property was legally hers alone. That was her late husband's insane idea. Even more unfortunately, she had relatives.'",
            "'When a wife's relatives get involved against a husband who is a gentleman, proud, and needs to be in charge, there's no peace. There was another issue. Madame Rigaud was, unfortunately, a bit common. I tried to improve her manners and class; she (backed up by her relatives) resented my efforts.'",
            "'We started arguing; and thanks to her relatives gossiping, the neighbours found out. People said I treated Madame Rigaud cruelly. I might have been seen slapping her face—nothing more. I have a light hand; if I corrected her like that, I did it almost playfully.'",
            "If Monsieur Rigaud's smile at this point was 'playful,' Madame Rigaud's relatives would probably have preferred him to be serious.",
            "'I am sensitive and brave. I don't say it's a merit, but it's who I am. If her male relatives had confronted me openly, I'd have dealt with them. They knew that, so they plotted in secret; consequently, Madame Rigaud and I clashed often.'",
            "'Even when I wanted a little money for personal expenses, I couldn't get it without a fight—and I'm a man who needs to be in charge! One night, Madame Rigaud and I were walking amicably—I might say like lovers—on a cliff overlooking the sea. Bad luck made Madame Rigaud bring up her relatives.'",
            "'I reasoned with her, pointing out her lack of loyalty in letting them turn her against her husband. She argued back; I argued back; she got angry; I got angry and provoked her. I admit it. Frankness is part of my character.'",
            "'Finally, in a fit of rage that I will always regret, Madame Rigaud threw herself at me screaming (no doubt people heard it far away), tore my clothes, tore my hair, scratched my hands, stomped on the ground, and finally leaped over the edge, dashing herself to death on the rocks below. That is the series of events that malice has twisted into me trying to force her to give up her rights, and when she refused, struggling with her—and assassinating her!'",
            "He stepped over to the ledge, picked up some vine leaves, and wiped his hands on them, with his back to the light.",
            "'Well,' he demanded after a silence, 'have you got nothing to say to that?'",
            "'It's ugly,' replied the little man, who had stood up and was sharpening his knife on his shoe, leaning against the wall.",
            "'What do you mean?' John Baptist polished his knife silently.",
            "'Do you mean I haven't told the story correctly?'",
            "'Al-tro!' said John Baptist. The word was an apology now, meaning 'Oh, definitely not!'",
            "'What then?'",
            "'Presidents and courts are so prejudiced.'",
            "'Well,' cried the other, nervously throwing his cloak over his shoulder with a curse, 'let them do their worst!'",
            "'I think they probably will,' murmured John Baptist to himself, tucking his knife into his sash.",
            "They didn't say anything else, though they both started pacing back and forth, crossing paths every time. Monsieur Rigaud sometimes stopped, as if to explain things differently or complain angrily; but since Signor Cavalletto kept jogging along looking at the floor, nothing came of it.",
            "Eventually, the sound of a key in the lock stopped them both. Voices followed, then footsteps. The door banged, and the jailer came slowly up the stairs, followed by a guard of soldiers.",
            "'Now, Monsieur Rigaud,' he said, pausing at the grate with his keys, 'please come out.'",
            "'I'm leaving in style, I see?'",
            "'Well, unless you did,' replied the jailer, 'you might leave in so many pieces we couldn't put you back together. There's a mob, Monsieur Rigaud, and they don't love you.'",
            "He unlocked a low door in the corner of the cell. 'Now,' he said, opening it, 'come out.'",
            "Monsieur Rigaud's face went a shade of white that doesn't exist anywhere else in nature. And no human expression looks quite like the one where you can see a terrified heart beating in every line of the face. People compare it to death, but the difference is huge—it's the difference between a struggle that's over and a fight at its most desperate moment.",
            "He lit another paper cigar from his companion's, clenched it in his teeth, pulled his hat down, threw his cloak over his shoulder, and walked out onto the gallery without looking at Signor Cavalletto again. As for the little man, he was focused entirely on getting near the door to look out. Just like a beast eyeing the freedom outside its cage, he spent those few seconds peering out until the door shut.",
            "There was an officer in charge of the soldiers; a stout, capable, very calm man with a drawn sword, smoking a cigar. He briefly ordered Monsieur Rigaud into the middle of the group, stood at the front with total indifference, said 'March!', and they all went clattering down the stairs. The door slammed—the key turned—and a ray of unusual light and fresh air seemed to vanish from the jail like a wisp of cigar smoke.",
            "Left alone, the prisoner jumped onto the ledge like a monkey or a small bear to catch the last glimpse of them leaving. As he held the grate, a roar of noise reached him: yells, screams, curses, threats—all mixed together into a raging storm of sound.",
            "Anxious to know more, he leaped down, ran around the cell, leaped back up, shook the grate, leaped down again, and didn't rest until the noise faded into the distance. How many better prisoners have worn themselves out like this, with no one thinking of them? Even great kings and governors who locked them up, riding happily in the sun with people cheering them on.",
            "At last, John Baptist lay down on the bench with his face on his crossed arms and fell asleep. In his obedience, his lightness, his good humour, his short-lived anger, his acceptance of hard bread and stone floors, and his ability to sleep anywhere, he was a true son of his country.",
            "The staring sun finally finished for the day; it went down in a red, green, and golden glory. The stars came out, and fireflies mimicked them in the air below. The long dusty roads and empty plains went quiet—and the sea was so hushed it barely whispered of the time when it shall give up its dead."

            "THE GOM JABBAR",
            "[Explanation: This is the title of the chapter. The Gom Jabbar is a key element you will learn about shortly. It's a test of humanity.]",
            "A beginning is the time when you have to be absolutely finicky about getting the balances right. Every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows this.",
            "[Explanation: This sets a philosophical tone. It introduces the Bene Gesserit, a powerful sisterhood, and suggests that beginnings are delicate and require great care. This hints at the complexity of the events about to unfold.]",
            "So, to start your study of the life of Muad’Dib, make sure you first place him in his proper time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV.",
            "[Explanation: The narrator, Princess Irulan, is writing a history. She introduces the main character, Paul Atreides (who will later be known as Muad'Dib), and gives his birth year, placing him in a specific historical context within this fictional universe.]",
            "And you must take special care to place Muad’Dib in his proper place: the planet Arrakis.",
            "[Explanation: This establishes the setting. Arrakis, also called Dune, is central to the story and to Paul's destiny, even though he wasn't born there.]",
            "Don’t be fooled by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is his true home. Forever.",
            "[Explanation: The narrator emphasizes that Paul's destiny is tied to the desert planet Arrakis, not his lush, water-rich homeworld of Caladan. This foreshadows a major life change for him.]",
            "—from ‘Manual of Muad’Dib’ by the Princess Irulan",
            "[Explanation: This tells us the opening text is an excerpt from a book written by Princess Irulan. She is a historian within the story, chronicling the life of the hero, Paul/Muad'Dib.]",
            "In the week before they were set to leave for Arrakis, when the final rush had turned into absolute bedlam, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul.",
            "[Explanation: The story begins. Paul's family is in the middle of a chaotic move to the planet Arrakis. A mysterious and important old woman arrives to see Paul's mother, Jessica.]",
            "It was a warm night at Castle Caladan. The ancient pile of stone, which had served the Atreides family as a home for twenty-six generations, had that clammy, \"sweating-wall\" feeling you get before the weather turns.",
            "[Explanation: This sets the scene on their home planet, Caladan. The mention of 26 generations shows that the Atreides family is an old and noble house. The 'sweating-wall' feeling creates a sense of foreboding, as if something bad is about to happen.]",
            "The old woman was let in by the side door, down the vaulted passage by Paul’s room. She was allowed a moment to peek in at him while he lay in bed.",
            "[Explanation: The old woman's secret entrance suggests she is powerful and doesn't follow normal rules. She immediately focuses on Paul.]",
            "By the dim light of a suspensor lamp hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother.",
            "[Explanation: From Paul's perspective, we see the old woman's imposing figure. The fact that she stands in front of his mother, a powerful Lady, shows the visitor has even higher rank and authority.]",
            "The old woman was like a witch from a storybook—hair like matted spiderwebs, a hood hiding her dark features, and eyes like glittering jewels.",
            "[Explanation: This description makes the old woman seem ancient, mysterious, and possibly dangerous. She is not an ordinary visitor.]",
            "\"Isn't he a bit small for his age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned guitar.",
            "[Explanation: Her first words are a criticism of Paul, showing she is judgmental and not here for a friendly chat. She addresses Paul's mother informally, reinforcing her superior status.]",
            "Paul’s mother answered in her soft, deep voice: \"The Atreides are known to start growing late, Your Reverence.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul's mother, Jessica, defends him respectfully. The title 'Your Reverence' confirms the old woman is a high-ranking religious figure, a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit.]",
            "\"So I’ve heard, so I’ve heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he’s already fifteen.\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother dismisses Jessica's explanation, showing her impatience and focus on Paul's current state. His age is significant for the test she has in mind.]",
            "\"Yes, Your Reverence.\"",
            "[Explanation: Jessica's simple, submissive reply highlights the power dynamic. She cannot argue with the Reverend Mother.]",
            "\"He’s awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\" She chuckled. \"But royalty needs to be sly. And if he really is the Kwisatz Haderach... well...\"",
            "[Explanation: The old woman knows Paul is faking sleep, showing her sharp perception. She introduces the term 'Kwisatz Haderach,' a mysterious title that hints at Paul's potential importance and connects to her purpose for being there.]",
            "In the shadows of his bed, Paul narrowed his eyes to slits. Two bird-bright ovals—the eyes of the old woman—seemed to expand and glow as they stared right into his.",
            "[Explanation: Paul is no longer just listening; he is now in a direct, silent confrontation with the old woman. Her eyes are described as powerful and penetrating.]",
            "\"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\" said the old woman. \"Tomorrow you’ll need all your wits about you to meet my gom jabbar.\"",
            "[Explanation: She issues a direct, ominous warning to Paul. She names the test she mentioned earlier: the 'gom jabbar.' This creates suspense and makes Paul (and the reader) wonder what it is.]",
            "And with that, she was gone, shoving his mother out and closing the door with a solid thump.",
            "[Explanation: Her abrupt and forceful exit, physically pushing Jessica, demonstrates her absolute authority. She is in control.]",
            "Paul lay awake wondering: What on earth is a gom jabbar?",
            "[Explanation: Paul is left with the central question of the chapter. This mystery drives the narrative forward.]",
            "In all the chaos during this move, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen.",
            "[Explanation: This emphasizes how unsettling the encounter was. Even with the stress of moving planets, this visit stands out as deeply unusual.]",
            "Your Reverence.",
            "[Explanation: Paul reflects on the title given to the old woman, recognizing it signifies a high and powerful rank.]",
            "And the way she called his mother \"Jessica\" like she was a common serving girl, instead of what she actually was—a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke’s partner, and mother of the heir.",
            "[Explanation: Paul is offended by the disrespect shown to his mother. He understands social hierarchy and sees that the Reverend Mother has treated Lady Jessica, a noblewoman, with shocking informality, revealing the visitor's immense power.]",
            "Is a gom jabbar something from Arrakis I need to know about before we go? he wondered.",
            "[Explanation: Paul tries to rationalize the strange word by connecting it to the new planet, Arrakis. He is trying to solve the mystery with the limited information he has.]",
            "He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar... Kwisatz Haderach.",
            "[Explanation: Paul repeats the mysterious terms, trying to understand their significance. These are the two key concepts introduced that will define his upcoming ordeal and his potential destiny.]",
            "There had been so much to learn. Arrakis would be so different from Caladan that Paul’s mind was spinning with the new information.",
            "[Explanation: This shows the pressure Paul is under. He's not just moving; he's preparing for a completely new and alien environment, which adds to his anxiety.]",
            "Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet.",
            "[Explanation: A simple, repeating mantra that reinforces the importance of the new world. It's harsh and defined by its single, dominant feature: the desert.]",
            "Thufir Hawat, his father’s Master of Assassins, had explained it all: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis for eighty years. They held the planet as a sort of semi-fiefdom under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange.",
            "[Explanation: This provides crucial political context. The Atreides family is taking over from their sworn enemies, the Harkonnens. The planet Arrakis is valuable because it's the only source of 'melange' or 'the spice,' a substance of immense importance in this universe.]",
            "Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in a complete fiefdom—an apparent victory for Duke Leto.",
            "[Explanation: On the surface, this move looks like a great honor and victory for Paul's father, Duke Leto. They are being granted full control of a valuable planet.]",
            "Yet, Hawat had said, this \"victory\" was actually incredibly dangerous, because Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad.",
            "[Explanation: This reveals the hidden danger. The move to Arrakis is not a reward but a trap. Paul's father has become too popular, making the Emperor jealous and nervous.]",
            "\"A popular man makes powerful people jealous,\" Hawat had said.",
            "[Explanation: This is a key political theme of the story. Popularity can be as dangerous as weakness, as it attracts the envy and fear of those in power, like the Emperor.]",
            "Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet.",
            "[Explanation: Paul's thoughts return to the planet, the center of this political trap and his family's new, dangerous home.]",
            "Paul fell asleep and dreamed of a cavern on Arrakis. There were silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes.",
            "[Explanation: This introduces Paul's ability to have prophetic dreams. He is seeing a glimpse of his future on Arrakis, a future that involves the native people of the planet.]",
            "It was solemn there, like a cathedral, and he listened to a faint sound—the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he was still dreaming, Paul knew he would remember it when he woke up. He always remembered the dreams that predicted the future.",
            "[Explanation: The dream feels significant, like a religious ceremony. The sound of dripping water is especially important because Arrakis is a desert planet where water is extremely precious. Paul recognizes this as a prescient dream, confirming he has special abilities.]",
            "The dream faded.",
            "[Explanation: The vision ends, leaving Paul with a memorable and mysterious glimpse of what's to come.]",
            "Paul half-woke to feel the warmth of his bed—thinking... thinking.",
            "[Explanation: Even in a state between sleep and wakefulness, his mind is active, processing the strange events and the impending move.]",
            "This world of Castle Caladan, without any mates his own age to play with, perhaps didn't deserve a sad farewell.",
            "[Explanation: Paul reflects on his isolated childhood. As a duke's heir, he has had a lonely upbringing, which makes leaving his home planet less emotionally difficult for him.]",
            "Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the class system wasn't so rigid on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without any commanders or lords to boss them about: \"will-o’-the-sand\" people called Fremen, who weren't listed on any Imperial census.",
            "[Explanation: Paul is intrigued by the Fremen, the native people of Arrakis. They represent a life of freedom, outside the strict social structure he knows. This hints at his future connection with them.]",
            "Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet.",
            "[Explanation: The mantra repeats, showing how his thoughts constantly circle back to his new, mysterious home.]",
            "Paul sensed his own stress and decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him.",
            "[Explanation: This shows that Paul is not just a normal boy; he has received special training from his mother in mental and physical self-control, a discipline known as the Bene Gesserit Way.]",
            "Three quick breaths triggered the response.",
            "[Explanation: He uses a specific technique to enter a meditative state, showing his training is precise and practiced.]",
            "He fell into the floating awareness... focusing his consciousness... dilating the aorta... avoiding the unfocused autopilot of the mind... choosing to be conscious...",
            "[Explanation: This describes the process of his mental discipline. He can consciously control his body's internal functions and focus his mind with incredible precision. This is not normal human ability.]",
            "Blood enriched and flooding the overload regions... you don't get food-safety-freedom by instinct alone... animal consciousness doesn't look beyond the current moment or understand that its species could go extinct...",
            "[Explanation: This is part of the litany or philosophy of his training. It emphasizes that human survival depends on conscious thought and planning, not just animal instinct.]",
            "The animal destroys and does not produce... animal pleasures stay close to simple sensation and avoid deep perception... the human requires a background grid to see his universe... focused consciousness forms your grid...",
            "[Explanation: The lesson continues, contrasting the short-sighted, destructive nature of an 'animal' with the structured, perceptive mind of a true 'human.' A human uses their consciousness to build a framework for understanding the world.]",
            "Bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs... all things/cells/beings are temporary... strive for flow-permanence within...",
            "[Explanation: This part of the lesson delves into the connection between mind and body, suggesting that mental control can influence physical health down to the cellular level. It ends with a philosophical point about finding permanence and stability within oneself in a temporary world.]",
            "Over and over and over, the lesson rolled through Paul’s floating awareness.",
            "[Explanation: Paul repeats this mental exercise until he achieves the desired state of calm and control.]",
            "When dawn touched Paul’s windowsill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids. He opened them, hearing the renewed hustle and bustle in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling.",
            "[Explanation: The night has passed, and Paul wakes up, his mind now calm and prepared for the day.]",
            "The hall door opened and his mother peered in. Her hair was like shaded bronze held with a black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless, her green eyes staring solemnly.",
            "[Explanation: Lady Jessica's appearance is described. Her controlled, emotionless expression is a hallmark of her Bene Gesserit training. She is hiding her own fear and anxiety.]",
            "\"You’re awake,\" she said. \"Did you sleep well?\"",
            "[Explanation: A simple question, but it carries the weight of her concern for him after the Reverend Mother's visit.]",
            "\"Yes.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul's short reply suggests he is also being guarded and controlled, using his own training.]",
            "He studied how tall she was, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothes for him from the closet racks. Anyone else might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way—in the tiny details of observation.",
            "[Explanation: This is a key moment. It shows that Paul's training allows him to see what others cannot—the subtle physical signs of his mother's true emotions. He can see the fear she is trying to hide.]",
            "She turned, holding a semi-formal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket.",
            "[Explanation: The jacket with the family crest is a symbol of his noble duty and heritage as an Atreides.]",
            "\"Hurry and get dressed,\" she said. \"Reverend Mother is waiting.\"",
            "[Explanation: The ordeal is about to begin. The Reverend Mother is not someone to be kept waiting.]",
            "\"I dreamed of her once,\" Paul said. \"Who is she?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul connects the old woman to his prophetic dreams, reinforcing that this meeting is fated. He asks his mother for information to prepare himself.]",
            "\"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she’s the Emperor’s Truthsayer. And Paul...\" She hesitated. \"You must tell her about your dreams.\"",
            "[Explanation: Jessica reveals the visitor's identity and incredible power: she was Jessica's teacher and is now the Emperor's official lie detector ('Truthsayer'). She knows Paul's dreams are important and must be shared.]",
            "\"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul makes an astute political guess, wondering if this powerful woman is connected to the dangerous 'gift' of Arrakis. He suspects a link between her visit and his family's predicament.]",
            "\"We did not get Arrakis.\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers and hung them with the jacket on the stand beside his bed. \"Don’t keep Reverend Mother waiting.\"",
            "[Explanation: Jessica's grim correction implies they were 'given' Arrakis as a trap, not a prize. She avoids a direct answer and pushes him to face the test, showing she is bound by the Reverend Mother's authority.]",
            "Paul sat up and hugged his knees. \"What’s a gom jabbar?\"",
            "[Explanation: He asks the question that has been haunting him. He is confronting the source of his fear directly before he has to face the test itself.]",
            "Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous slip he felt as fear.",
            "[Explanation: Paul's heightened senses, a result of his training, pick up on his mother's fear once more. He can tell the 'gom jabbar' is something truly terrifying.]",
            "Jessica walked to the window, threw the curtains wide, and stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi.",
            "[Explanation: She physically turns away, unable to face him while discussing the gom jabbar. This is a sign of her inner conflict and fear for his safety.]",
            "\"You’ll learn about... the gom jabbar soon enough,\" she said.",
            "[Explanation: She cannot or will not tell him what it is, leaving him to face it blind. This increases the tension and highlights her powerlessness in this situation.]",
            "He heard the fear in her voice and wondered why.",
            "[Explanation: Paul is more curious and concerned than afraid at this moment. He is analyzing his mother's reaction, trying to understand the source of her terror.]",
            "Jessica spoke without turning. \"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\"",
            "[Explanation: The final command. Jessica cannot delay the test any longer. She is sending her son to face a great danger.]",
            "The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in a tapestried chair watching mother and son approach.",
            "[Explanation: We are now in the presence of the Reverend Mother. Her name is given, and she is positioned as an authority figure, waiting to pass judgment.]",
            "Windows on each side of her overlooked the curving southern bend of the river and the green farmlands of the Atreides estate, but the Reverend Mother ignored the view.",
            "[Explanation: The beautiful, peaceful view of Caladan contrasts with the tension of the scene. The Reverend Mother's disinterest in it shows she is focused entirely on her serious purpose.]",
            "She was feeling her age this morning, and was more than a little cranky. She blamed it on space travel and associating with that abominable Spacing Guild and its secretive ways.",
            "[Explanation: This humanizes the Reverend Mother slightly. She is not just an imposing figure but also an old woman who gets tired and annoyed. It also introduces the 'Spacing Guild,' another major power in the universe, which controls all space travel.]",
            "But here was a mission that required personal attention from a Bene Gesserit-with-the-Sight. Even the Padishah Emperor’s Truthsayer couldn’t dodge that responsibility when duty called.",
            "[Explanation: This mission is so important that she had to come in person. Her titles 'Bene Gesserit-with-the-Sight' (implying she has prophetic abilities) and 'Emperor's Truthsayer' are re-stated to emphasize her immense power and why she is the one to test Paul.]",
            "Damn that Jessica! the Reverend Mother thought. If only she’d borne us a girl as she was ordered to do!",
            "[Explanation: This is a crucial revelation. Jessica was ordered by the Bene Gesserit to have a daughter, but she defied them and had a son (Paul) for her Duke. This is the source of the tension and the reason for this test. Jessica broke a major rule.]",
            "Jessica stopped three paces from the chair and dropped a small curtsy, a gentle flick of her left hand along the line of her skirt.",
            "[Explanation: Jessica shows formal deference to her former teacher, acknowledging the Reverend Mother's superior rank within the Bene Gesserit sisterhood.]",
            "Paul gave the short bow his dancing master had taught him—the one used \"when in doubt of another’s rank.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul's bow is polite but cautious. It shows he is aware of social subtleties and is not offering complete submission, as he doesn't fully understand the old woman's status or intent.]",
            "The nuances of Paul’s greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She said: \"He’s a cautious one, Jessica.\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother immediately recognizes the meaning behind Paul's careful bow. She sees that he is intelligent and not easily intimidated.]",
            "Jessica’s hand went to Paul’s shoulder and tightened there. For a heartbeat, fear pulsed through her palm. Then she got herself under control.",
            "[Explanation: Jessica is terrified for her son, and her fear momentarily breaks through her disciplined control. This physical sign of fear is a major display of emotion for a Bene Gesserit.]",
            "\"Thus he has been taught, Your Reverence.\"",
            "[Explanation: Jessica deflects, attributing Paul's caution to his formal training, trying to present him in the best possible light.]",
            "What is she afraid of? Paul wondered.",
            "[Explanation: Paul, feeling his mother's fear but not understanding its source, is confused. He doesn't realize the test is a life-or-death matter.]",
            "The old woman studied Paul in one quick glance: face oval like Jessica’s, but strong bones... hair: the Duke’s jet-black but with the brow-line of the maternal grandfather who cannot be named, and that thin, disdainful nose; shape of directly staring green eyes: like the old Duke, the paternal grandfather who is dead.",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother is analyzing Paul's genetic heritage through his physical features. She is looking for specific traits from both his mother's and father's bloodlines. The 'grandfather who cannot be named' is a hint at a dark or forbidden secret in Jessica's lineage.]",
            "Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of showing off—even in death, the Reverend Mother thought.",
            "[Explanation: She remembers Paul's paternal grandfather (the 'old Duke') as someone who understood theatrics and power, qualities she seems to respect.]",
            "\"Teaching is one thing,\" she said, \"the basic ingredient is another. We shall see.\" The old eyes darted a hard look at Jessica. \"Leave us. I order you to practice the meditation of peace.\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother dismisses training as secondary to a person's innate nature ('the basic ingredient'). She then formally orders Jessica to leave and to meditate, a command that implies Jessica needs to control her own fear and not interfere.]",
            "Jessica took her hand from Paul’s shoulder. \"Your Reverence, I—\"",
            "[Explanation: Jessica starts to protest, her maternal instinct to protect her son warring with her duty to obey.]",
            "\"Jessica, you know it must be done.\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother cuts her off, reminding her that this test is a mandatory and unavoidable Bene Gesserit procedure.]",
            "Paul looked up at his mother, puzzled.",
            "[Explanation: Paul is still in the dark. He doesn't understand the gravity of the situation or why his mother is being dismissed so forcefully.]",
            "Jessica straightened up. \"Yes... of course.\"",
            "[Explanation: Jessica capitulates. Her training and her duty to the Sisterhood win out over her maternal fear. She accepts the necessity of the test.]",
            "Paul looked back at the Reverend Mother. Politeness and his mother’s obvious awe of this old woman argued for caution. Yet he felt an angry worry at the fear he sensed radiating from his mother.",
            "[Explanation: Paul is conflicted. He knows he should be respectful, but his mother's fear is making him angry and protective.]",
            "\"Paul...\" Jessica took a deep breath. \"... this test you’re about to receive... it’s important to me.\"",
            "[Explanation: This is Jessica's final plea to Paul. She can't tell him what the test is, but she is begging him with her words to pass it, for her sake.]",
            "\"Test?\" He looked up at her.",
            "[Explanation: The word 'test' confirms this isn't just a conversation. Something is about to happen to him that he must endure.]",
            "\"Remember that you’re a duke’s son,\" Jessica said. She spun around and strode from the room with a dry swishing of her skirt. The door closed solidly behind her.",
            "[Explanation: Her last words are a reminder of his nobility and the strength expected of him. She then leaves quickly, unable to watch what is about to happen.]",
            "Paul faced the old woman, keeping his anger in check. \"Does one dismiss the Lady Jessica as though she were a serving girl?\"",
            "[Explanation: Now alone with the Reverend Mother, Paul's anger and pride surface. He directly challenges her for the disrespect she showed his mother.]",
            "A smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth. \"The Lady Jessica was my serving girl, lad, for fourteen years at school.\" She nodded. \"And a good one, too. Now, you come here!\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother casually asserts her authority by revealing she was Jessica's teacher, putting Jessica's rank in perspective. Her sharp command at the end is a test of Paul's obedience.]",
            "The command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he could think about it.",
            "[Explanation: Paul is compelled to obey against his will. This is his first experience with 'the Voice'.]",
            "Using the Voice on me, he thought. He stopped at her gesture, standing beside her knees.",
            "[Explanation: Paul correctly identifies the technique being used on him. The 'Voice' is a Bene Gesserit skill that uses specific vocal tones to issue commands that are nearly impossible to resist. The fact that he can recognize it is a sign of his own training.]",
            "\"See this?\" she asked.",
            "[Explanation: The test begins. She is about to reveal one of its tools.]",
            "From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green metal cube about fifteen centimetres on one side. She turned it and Paul saw that one side was open—black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open blackness.",
            "[Explanation: This is the mystery box. Its unnatural darkness makes it immediately terrifying and suggests it's a product of advanced and strange technology.]",
            "\"Put your right hand in the box,\" she said.",
            "[Explanation: A direct, simple command that is the first step of the physical ordeal.]",
            "Fear shot through Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said: \"Is this how you obey your mother?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul's natural instinct is to refuse, but the Reverend Mother uses emotional manipulation, invoking his mother's final request to force him to comply.]",
            "He looked up into those bird-bright eyes.",
            "[Explanation: He is locked in a battle of wills with the old woman, communicated through their gaze.]",
            "Slowly, feeling the compulsion and unable to stop it, Paul put his hand into the box. He felt a sense of cold first as the blackness closed around his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling sensation, as though his hand were asleep.",
            "[Explanation: He submits and places his hand in the box. The sensations are strange and unnatural—cold, metallic, and a 'prickling' that hints at nerve manipulation.]",
            "A predatory look filled the old woman’s face. She lifted her right hand away from the box and poised it close to the side of Paul’s neck. He saw a glint of metal there and started to turn toward it.",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother's expression shifts, revealing her role as the tester or predator. She reveals the second part of the test apparatus: a needle at his neck.]",
            "\"Stop!\" she snapped.",
            "[Explanation: She uses the Voice again to control his physical reaction, preventing him from seeing the needle clearly or pulling away.]",
            "Using the Voice again! He swung his attention back to her face.",
            "[Explanation: Paul is again aware that he is being controlled, but he is powerless to resist it. He is forced to focus on her.]",
            "\"I hold at your neck the gom jabbar,\" she said. \"The gom jabbar, the high-handed enemy. It’s a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don’t pull away or you’ll feel that poison.\"",
            "[Explanation: The mystery is solved. The Gom Jabbar is a poison needle. The name itself means 'the high-handed enemy,' a term for a foe you cannot out-maneuver. The threat is now clear and immediate.]",
            "Paul tried to swallow, but his throat was dry. He couldn't take his eyes off the wrinkled old face, the glistening eyes, the pale gums around silvery metal teeth that flashed as she spoke.",
            "[Explanation: His physical reaction to fear is intense. The description of her metallic teeth adds to her alien and intimidating presence.]",
            "\"A duke’s son must know about poisons,\" she said. \"It’s the way of our times, eh? Musky, to be poisoned in your drink. Aumas, to be poisoned in your food. The quick ones and the slow ones and the ones in between. Here’s a new one for you: the gom jabbar. It kills only animals.\"",
            "[Explanation: She frames the test in the context of the political realities of his world, where assassination by poison is common. Her final statement, 'It kills only animals,' is the core of the test's purpose: to see if he will react like a panicked animal or a thinking human.]",
            "Pride overcame Paul’s fear. \"You dare suggest a duke’s son is an animal?\" he demanded.",
            "[Explanation: Paul's noble pride is stung. He instinctively pushes back against her insult, a sign of his strong sense of self and status.]",
            "\"Let us say I suggest you may be human,\" she said. \"Steady! I warn you not to try jerking away. I am old, but my hand can drive this needle into your neck before you escape me.\"",
            "[Explanation: She clarifies her statement: being 'human' is something to be proven, not assumed. She reasserts her physical control over him, reminding him that despite her age, she is faster and more dangerous than he is.]",
            "\"Who are you?\" he whispered. \"How did you trick my mother into leaving me alone with you? Are you from the Harkonnens?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul's mind races, trying to understand the situation. He asks who she is and suspects she might be one of his family's mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, trying to assassinate him under the guise of a test.]",
            "\"The Harkonnens? Bless us, no! Now, be silent.\" A dry finger touched his neck and he stilled the involuntary urge to leap away.",
            "[Explanation: She dismisses his suspicion and once again forces him into stillness with a touch, demonstrating her absolute control over the situation.]",
            "\"Good,\" she said. \"You pass the first test. Now, here’s how the rest of it works: If you take your hand out of the box, you die. That is the only rule. Keep your hand in the box and live. Take it out and die.\"",
            "[Explanation: The first part of the test was simply enduring her presence and threats without panicking. Now she lays out the simple, brutal rule for the main ordeal: endure the pain in the box or die instantly by the needle.]",
            "Paul took a deep breath to stop his trembling. \"If I call out, there’ll be servants on you in seconds and you’ll die.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul tries to regain some control by threatening her, testing her confidence and looking for a weakness in her plan.]",
            "\"Servants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door. Depend on it. Your mother survived this test. Now it’s your turn. Be honoured. We seldom administer this to boys.\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother dismantles his threat. She reveals that his own mother is acting as her guard and that Jessica herself passed this same test. This confirms it is a Bene Gesserit ritual, and the final statement implies that Paul is being tested because he is a male with potential, which is rare and significant.]",
            "Curiosity reduced Paul’s fear to a manageable level. He heard truth in the old woman’s voice; there was no denying it. If his mother stood guard out there... if this were truly a test...",
            "[Explanation: Her words have the ring of truth. Understanding that this is a formal, recognized test (and not just a random attack) helps Paul frame it mentally. His curiosity and analytical mind begin to take over from his pure fear.]",
            "And whatever it was, he knew he was caught in it, trapped by that hand at his neck: the gom jabbar. He recalled the response from the Litany against Fear as his mother had taught him from the Bene Gesserit rite.",
            "[Explanation: He accepts his situation is inescapable. He then turns to his mental training, specifically the 'Litany Against Fear,' a Bene Gesserit tool for mastering one's emotions.]",
            "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.",
            "[Explanation: This is the full Litany Against Fear. It's a meditative mantra designed to allow a person to acknowledge fear without being controlled by it. It is a core philosophy of the Bene Gesserit and a central theme of the book.]",
            "He felt calmness return, and said: \"Get on with it, old woman.\"",
            "[Explanation: The litany works. Paul masters his fear and regains his composure. He challenges her to begin the test, showing his defiance and courage.]",
            "\"Old woman!\" she snapped. \"You’ve got guts, I'll give you that. Well, we shall see, sirra.\"",
            "[Explanation: She is slightly annoyed by his disrespect but also impressed by his bravery. 'Sirra' is an archaic, somewhat condescending term for a young man.]",
            "She bent close, lowering her voice almost to a whisper. \"You will feel pain in this hand within the box. Pain. But! Withdraw the hand and I’ll touch your neck with my gom jabbar—the death so swift it’s like the fall of the headsman’s axe. Withdraw your hand and the gom jabbar takes you. Understand?\"",
            "[Explanation: She repeats the rules one last time, emphasizing the agonizing choice he faces: endure unimaginable pain or choose instant death.]",
            "\"What’s in the box?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul still tries to gather information, to understand the mechanism of the test.]",
            "\"Pain.\"",
            "[Explanation: Her one-word answer is absolute and terrifying. The box does not contain a physical object that causes pain (like fire or blades); the box *is* pain itself.]",
            "He felt increased tingling in his hand and pressed his lips tightly together. How could this be a test? he wondered. The tingling became an itch.",
            "[Explanation: The sensation in his hand begins to change, starting subtly. He is still struggling to understand the purpose of what seems like simple torture.]",
            "The old woman said: \"You’ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? That’s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death so that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind.\"",
            "[Explanation: She explains the philosophy of the test. An animal reacts to pain with instinct, seeking only to escape. A 'human,' by her definition, thinks beyond the immediate pain. A human can endure suffering for a greater, long-term purpose, like defeating an enemy.]",
            "The itch became the faintest burning. \"Why are you doing this?\" he demanded.",
            "[Explanation: The pain is starting to build. His question is a plea for reason, a desperate attempt to understand the logic behind his suffering.]",
            "\"To determine if you’re human. Be silent.\"",
            "[Explanation: She gives the same stark answer. This is the test that separates humans from animals in the eyes of the Bene Gesserit. Her command to 'be silent' forces him to turn inward and face the pain without distraction.]",
            "Paul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation increased in the other hand. It mounted slowly: heat upon heat upon heat... upon heat.",
            "[Explanation: The pain intensifies relentlessly. He uses his free hand to anchor himself, channeling his agony into a physical clench.]",
            "He felt the fingernails of his free hand biting into his palm. He tried to flex the fingers of the burning hand, but couldn't move them.",
            "[Explanation: He is losing control of his tortured hand, but he redirects the pain into self-inflicted pain in his other hand, a desperate act of self-control.]",
            "\"It burns,\" he whispered.",
            "[Explanation: The pain becomes so overwhelming that it escapes his attempt at silence. It is a primal, involuntary reaction.]",
            "\"Silence!\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother offers no sympathy, only the sharp command to endure. She is forcing him to master even his involuntary responses.]",
            "Pain throbbed up his arm. Sweat stood out on his forehead. Every fibre of his body cried out to yank the hand from the burning pit... but... the gom jabbar.",
            "[Explanation: His animal survival instinct is screaming at him to pull his hand out. The only thing stopping him is the conscious knowledge of the gom jabbar at his neck—the certain death that awaits if he gives in to instinct.]",
            "Without turning his head, he tried to move his eyes to see that terrible needle poised beside his neck. He sensed that he was breathing in gasps, tried to slow his breaths and couldn't.",
            "[Explanation: He is losing control over his body's autonomic responses. His breathing becomes panicked, and he is desperately trying to use his training to manage the overwhelming physical and mental stress.]",
            "Pain!",
            "[Explanation: The experience has been reduced to a single, all-encompassing reality.]",
            "His world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony, and the ancient face inches away staring at him.",
            "[Explanation: This is the climax of the test. His consciousness has narrowed to only two things: the source of the pain and the face of his tormentor, who is watching his every reaction.]",
            "His lips were so dry he had a difficulty separating them.",
            "[Explanation: A physical detail illustrating the extreme dehydration and stress his body is under.]",
            "The burning! The burning!",
            "[Explanation: He is at his absolute limit, his mind consumed by the sensation.]",
            "He thought he could feel skin curling black on that agonised hand, the flesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained.",
            "[Explanation: The pain is so intense that his mind creates a vivid, horrifying illusion of his hand being physically destroyed by fire. This is a purely neurological experience, but it feels completely real.]",
            "It stopped!",
            "[Explanation: The abrupt end of the pain is as shocking as its onset.]",
            "As though a switch had been turned off, the pain stopped.",
            "[Explanation: This confirms the pain was not from a real physical source but was induced and controlled externally, likely by the technology in the box.]",
            "Paul felt his right arm trembling, felt sweat bathing his body.",
            "[Explanation: The physical aftermath of the ordeal. His body is reacting to the extreme stress it just endured.]",
            "\"Enough,\" the old woman muttered. \"Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must’ve wanted you to fail.\"",
            "[Explanation: She is shocked. 'Kull wahad!' is an expression of surprise. She reveals that he endured more pain than any female trainee ever has. Her admission that she 'wanted him to fail' suggests a bias against him, perhaps because he is a boy who resulted from Jessica's disobedience.]",
            "She leaned back, taking the gom jabbar away from his neck. \"Take your hand from the box, young human, and look at it.\"",
            "[Explanation: The threat is removed. She acknowledges him as a 'young human,' confirming he has passed the test. She commands him to look at his hand.]",
            "He fought down an aching shiver, staring at the lightless void where his hand seemed to stay of its own free will. Memory of pain stopped every movement. Reason told him he would pull out a blackened stump from that box.",
            "[Explanation: Paul is suffering from a form of shock. The memory of the pain is so vivid that he cannot believe his hand is unharmed. His logical mind expects to see the damage his senses told him was happening.]",
            "\"Do it!\" she snapped.",
            "[Explanation: She forces him to confront the reality and break free from the psychological trauma of the test.]",
            "He jerked his hand from the box and stared at it, astonished.",
            "[Explanation: The moment of revelation. He sees that his hand is perfectly fine.]",
            "Not a mark. No sign of agony on the flesh. He held up the hand, turned it, flexed the fingers.",
            "[Explanation: The proof. The pain was entirely in his mind, induced by the box. His physical body is completely unharmed. The test was purely one of mental and spiritual endurance.]",
            "\"Pain by nerve induction,\" she said. \"Can’t go around maiming potential humans. There are those who’d give a pretty penny for the secret of this box, though.\" She slipped it into the folds of her gown.",
            "[Explanation: She explains the technology behind the test. The box directly stimulates the nerves to create the sensation of pain. She also notes its value, hinting at the Bene Gesserit's advanced and secret knowledge.]",
            "\"But the pain—\" he said.",
            "[Explanation: Paul is still struggling to reconcile the intensity of what he felt with the lack of physical evidence.]",
            "\"Pain,\" she sniffed. \"A human can override any nerve in the body.\"",
            "[Explanation: She dismisses his struggle, stating the core belief of the Bene Gesserit: a true 'human' has mastery over their own physical and mental responses, to the point of being able to consciously ignore or control any nerve signal.]",
            "Paul felt his left hand aching, uncurled the clenched fingers, and looked at four bloody marks where his fingernails had bitten his palm. He dropped the hand to his side and looked at the old woman.",
            "[Explanation: He sees the only real physical damage from the test—the wounds he inflicted on himself to endure the pain. It's a stark symbol that the only harm came from his own struggle to maintain control.]",
            "\"You did that to my mother once?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul now understands the full scope of what his mother went through. His question shows a new level of empathy and respect for her strength.]",
            "\"Ever sift sand through a screen?\" she asked.",
            "[Explanation: She answers his question with a metaphor. The test is like a sieve used to separate coarse gravel from fine sand.]",
            "The sideways slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher awareness: Sand through a screen. He nodded.",
            "[Explanation: Paul instantly understands the metaphor. The test is a tool for filtering people.]",
            "\"We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.\"",
            "[Explanation: She states the purpose of her order plainly. They use this test to find individuals who have risen above their animal instincts and possess the self-control they define as 'human.']",
            "He lifted his right hand, willing the memory of the pain to return. \"And that’s all there is to it—pain?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul is trying to understand the test more deeply. Is it just about pain tolerance, or is there more to it?]",
            "\"I observed you in pain, lad. Pain’s merely the axis of the test. Your mother’s told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her teaching in you. Our test is crisis and observation.\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother explains that the pain is just the catalyst. The real test is how he behaved *during* the crisis. She was observing every tiny detail of his reaction, looking for signs of his training and his innate nature.]",
            "He heard the confirmation in her voice, said: \"It’s the truth!\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul uses his own budding ability to sense truth, confirming that what she says is genuine. This is the first time he consciously uses this skill.]",
            "She stared at him. He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly be the one? She extinguished the excitement, reminding herself: Hope clouds observation.",
            "[Explanation: She is stunned. Paul's ability to perceive truth is a rare and powerful gift, a key sign of the Kwisatz Haderach. She has to suppress her own hope and excitement to remain an objective observer, following her Bene Gesserit training.]",
            "\"You know when people believe what they say,\" she said.",
            "[Explanation: She is testing him, asking him to confirm what she just realized about his ability.]",
            "\"I know it.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul confirms his ability with simple certainty.]",
            "The harmonics of ability confirmed by repeated testing were in his voice. She heard them and said: \"Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Sit down, little brother, here at my feet.\"",
            "[Explanation: His voice itself carries the signs of his power. Now convinced of his potential, her tone shifts. She calls him 'little brother,' a term of respect within the sisterhood, and invites him to sit, treating him as a potential equal.]",
            "\"I prefer to stand.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul refuses to submit. Having passed the test, he is no longer intimidated and asserts his own will and status.]",
            "\"Your mother sat at my feet once.\"",
            "[Explanation: She tries to assert dominance by comparing him to his mother, who was her subordinate.]",
            "\"I’m not my mother.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul rejects the comparison. He is establishing his own identity, separate from his mother and her obligations to the Bene Gesserit.]",
            "\"You hate us a little, eh?\" She looked toward the door and called out: \"Jessica!\"",
            "[Explanation: She correctly identifies his resentment toward her and the Bene Gesserit for what they put him and his mother through. She then summons Jessica back into the room.]",
            "The door flew open and Jessica stood there staring hard-eyed into the room. The hardness melted from her as she saw Paul. She managed a faint smile.",
            "[Explanation: Jessica enters, full of anxiety. Seeing Paul is alive and well, her relief is immediate and visible.]",
            "\"Jessica, have you ever stopped hating me?\" the old woman asked.",
            "[Explanation: A deeply personal question. The Reverend Mother wants to know if Jessica ever forgave her for the pain of her own training and the burdens of being a Bene Gesserit.]",
            "\"I both love and hate you,\" Jessica said. \"The hate—that’s from pains I must never forget. The love—that’s...\"",
            "[Explanation: Jessica gives an honest, complex answer. She hates the Reverend Mother for the suffering inherent in their Way, but she also loves her for... something deeper and more fundamental.]",
            "\"Just the basic fact,\" the old woman said, but her voice was gentle. \"You may come in now, but remain silent. Close the door and make sure no one interrupts us.\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother finishes Jessica's sentence, suggesting the 'love' is simply an acknowledgment of their shared purpose and bond as Bene Gesserit. Her tone becomes gentle, showing a rare moment of understanding before she reasserts her authority.]",
            "Jessica stepped into the room, closed the door and stood with her back to it. My son lives, she thought. My son lives and is... human. I knew he was... but... he lives. Now, I can go on living.",
            "[Explanation: Jessica's internal monologue reveals the depth of her terror. She was not sure he would survive. His survival means he has passed the test of humanity, and her relief is so profound that she feels her own life can now continue.]",
            "The door felt hard and real against her back. Everything in the room felt immediate and pressing against her senses.",
            "[Explanation: Her senses are heightened by the extreme emotional release. The world feels sharp and real again after being clouded by fear.]",
            "My son lives.",
            "[Explanation: The simple, powerful thought that defines her entire world at this moment.]",
            "Paul looked at his mother. She told the truth. He wanted to get away alone and think this experience through, but knew he could not leave until he was dismissed. The old woman had gained a power over him. They spoke the truth. His mother had undergone this test.",
            "[Explanation: Paul processes everything. He understands his mother's role, the truth of the test, and the new power dynamic. The Reverend Mother has earned his respect through the ordeal, and he knows he must wait for her permission to leave.]",
            "There must be a terrible purpose in it... the pain and fear had been terrible. He understood terrible purposes. They drove against all odds. They were their own necessity. Paul felt that he had been infected with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose was.",
            "[Explanation: This is a pivotal moment for Paul. He recognizes that such an extreme test must have an equally extreme purpose. He feels that this purpose has now been passed on to him, like an infection. He has been initiated into something vast and dangerous, even if he doesn't understand it yet.]",
            "\"Some day, lad,\" the old woman said, \"you, too, may have to stand outside a door like that. It takes a bit of doing.\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother acknowledges the difficulty of what Jessica just did—letting a loved one face a life-or-death test. She is hinting that Paul, too, may one day have to make a similar, terrible choice.]",
            "Paul looked down at the hand that had known pain, then up to the Reverend Mother. The sound of her voice had contained a difference then from any other voice in his experience. The words were outlined in brilliance. There was an edge to them. He felt that any question he might ask her would bring an answer that could lift him out of his flesh-world into something greater.",
            "[Explanation: Paul's perception has been altered by the ordeal. He now hears her voice differently, sensing the depth of knowledge and power behind her words. He feels he is on the verge of a higher understanding.]",
            "\"Why do you test for humans?\" he asked.",
            "[Explanation: He asks the fundamental question. He wants to know the ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit's quest to find and separate 'humans' from 'animals.']",
            "\"To set you free.\"",
            "[Explanation: Her answer is cryptic and philosophical. The Bene Gesserit believe that by forcing humanity to evolve past its animal instincts, they are freeing it from its limitations.]",
            "\"Free?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul is skeptical. The test felt like a trap, not a liberation.]",
            "\"Once, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.\"",
            "[Explanation: She is referencing a major event in the history of this universe: the Butlerian Jihad. Humanity once created advanced AI ('thinking machines'), but these machines were used to oppress people. This led to a galactic war to destroy all thinking machines.]",
            "\"'Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man’s mind,'\" Paul quoted.",
            "[Explanation: Paul quotes the primary commandment from the Orange Catholic Bible, the main religious text of the empire. It is the law that forbids the creation of artificial intelligence, born from the trauma of the Butlerian Jihad.]",
            "\"Right out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic Bible,\" she said. \"But what the O.C. Bible should’ve said is: 'Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.' Have you studied the Mentat in your service?\"",
            "[Explanation: She corrects the scripture, arguing the problem isn't making intelligent machines, but making machines that *imitate* the human mind, which makes humans lazy and weak. She then points to Mentats as an alternative.]",
            "\"I’ve studied with Thufir Hawat.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul confirms he knows about Mentats. Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, is a Mentat—a 'human computer.' Mentats are people trained to have perfect memory and superhuman powers of logic and calculation.]",
            "\"The Great Revolt took away a crutch,\" she said. \"It forced human minds to develop. Schools were started to train human talents.\"",
            "[Explanation: The war against the machines (the 'Great Revolt' or Butlerian Jihad) forced humanity to develop its own mental potential instead of relying on computers. This led to the creation of specialized schools, like those for Mentats and the Bene Gesserit.]",
            "\"Bene Gesserit schools?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul makes the connection, realizing his mother's school is one of these ancient institutions dedicated to honing human potential.]",
            "She nodded. \"We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasises almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.\"",
            "[Explanation: She confirms his guess and names the two most powerful schools: the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. She suggests the Guild focuses on the logic needed for space travel, while the Bene Gesserit have a different, unstated purpose.]",
            "\"Politics,\" he said.",
            "[Explanation: Paul correctly guesses the Bene Gesserit's true function. They are political manipulators, working behind the scenes to guide humanity.]",
            "\"Kull wahad!\" the old woman said. She sent a hard glance at Jessica.",
            "[Explanation: She is again shocked by his insight ('Kull wahad!'). She looks at Jessica, suspecting she told him this, as it's a closely guarded secret.]",
            "\"I’ve not told him, Your Reverence,\" Jessica said.",
            "[Explanation: Jessica truthfully denies telling Paul their secrets, confirming that his insight is his own.]",
            "The Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul. \"You worked that out on remarkably few clues,\" she said. \"Politics indeed. The original Bene Gesserit school was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in human affairs. They saw there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock—for breeding purposes.\"",
            "[Explanation: She confirms he is right and reveals the Bene Gesserit's ultimate goal: they are running a secret, centuries-long genetic breeding program. They guide politics and arrange marriages between noble houses to selectively breed for specific traits, all to produce their desired 'Kwisatz Haderach.']",
            "The old woman’s words abruptly lost their special sharpness for Paul. He felt an offence against what his mother called his instinct for rightness. It wasn’t that the Reverend Mother lied to him. She obviously believed what she said. It was something deeper, something tied to his terrible purpose.",
            "[Explanation: Paul has a profound, intuitive reaction against the breeding program. It feels fundamentally wrong to him. It's not a logical disagreement, but a deep-seated moral conflict that connects to the 'terrible purpose' he now feels within himself.]",
            "He said: \"But my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don’t know their ancestry.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul challenges her. If they are running a breeding program, why would they keep their own members in the dark about their parentage?]",
            "\"The genetic lines are always in our records,\" she said. \"Your mother knows that either she’s of Bene Gesserit descent or her stock was acceptable in itself.\"",
            "[Explanation: She confirms they do keep records, but not all members need to know the details. His mother was selected for the program because she had the right genes.]",
            "\"Then why couldn’t she know who her parents are?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul presses the point, sensing a contradiction and a personal secret.]",
            "\"Some do... Many don’t. We might, for example, have wanted to breed her to a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait. We have many reasons.\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother gives a chillingly practical answer. They might arrange incestuous pairings if it serves the breeding program's goals. This highlights their cold, calculating approach to human lives.]",
            "Again, Paul felt the offence against rightness. He said: \"You take a lot on yourselves.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul is morally repulsed by their arrogance and their treatment of people as mere tools in a genetic experiment. He openly criticizes their mission.]",
            "The Reverend Mother stared at him, wondering: Did I hear criticism in his voice? \"We carry a heavy burden,\" she said.",
            "[Explanation: She is taken aback by his open defiance. She defends their actions by framing them as a heavy responsibility they bear for the good of humanity.]",
            "Paul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test. He levelled a measuring stare at her, said: \"You say maybe I’m the... Kwisatz Haderach. What’s that, a human gom jabbar?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul is now fully recovered and on the offensive. He directly asks for a definition of the Kwisatz Haderach and cleverly compares it to the 'gom jabbar,' asking if it is just another tool or weapon they use to control people.]",
            "\"Paul,\" Jessica said. \"You mustn’t take that tone with—\"",
            "[Explanation: Jessica is terrified by Paul's confrontational tone. He is speaking to a Reverend Mother with a level of disrespect that could be deadly.]",
            "\"I’ll handle this, Jessica,\" the old woman said. \"Now, lad, do you know about the Truthsayer drug?\"",
            "[Explanation: The Reverend Mother stops Jessica, intrigued by Paul's challenge. She changes the subject to the 'Truthsayer drug,' which is the source of the spice, melange.]",
            "\"You take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood,\" he said. \"My mother’s told me.\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul confirms he knows the drug's basic purpose.]",
            "\"Have you ever seen a truthtrance?\"",
            "[Explanation: A truthtrance is the altered state of consciousness a Truthsayer enters after taking the spice-drug.]",
            "He shook his head. \"No.\"",
            "[Explanation: He has no firsthand experience with this power.]",
            "\"The drug’s dangerous,\" she said, \"but it gives insight. When a Truthsayer’s gifted by the drug, she can look many places in her memory—in her body’s memory. We look down so many avenues of the past... but only feminine avenues.\"",
            "[Explanation: She explains the power and the limitation of the drug. It unlocks 'Other Memory'—the combined memories of all of one's female ancestors. However, they can only see the female line of their ancestry.]",
            "Her voice took on a note of sadness. \"Yet, there’s a place where no Truthsayer can see. We are repelled by it, terrorised. It is said a man will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where we cannot—into both feminine and masculine pasts.\"",
            "[Explanation: She reveals the 'wall' they cannot pass. For a female Bene Gesserit, the male side of her ancestral memories is a black, terrifying void they cannot enter. The prophecy states that a male Bene Gesserit will one day be able to survive the process and access both male and female ancestral memories.]",
            "\"Your Kwisatz Haderach?\"",
            "[Explanation: Paul understands. The Kwisatz Haderach is the prophesied male Bene Gesserit who can bridge this gap and see the totality of human history.]"

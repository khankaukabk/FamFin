    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure security, scalability, and ease of debugging, adhering to the principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC, and QAPs. User-owned data (Income and Expenses) is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring clear ownership and straightforward security rules. This eliminates the need for complex `get()` calls to determine authorization and facilitates atomic operations. The design leverages path-based ownership, making the security rules simple and efficient. There is no collaborative data in the model. Since all the data is user-owned, there is no need for membership maps. This structure supports required QAPs by ensuring that `list` operations are secure and restricted to the user's own data."

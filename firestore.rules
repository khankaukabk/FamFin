/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Family Financials application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where each user can only
 * access their own data, ensuring data privacy and security.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with 'userId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/incomes/{incomeId}: Stores income records for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense records for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is nested under /users/{userId} to enforce strict ownership.
 * - All 'list' operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 * - The rules explicitly deny any unauthorized access attempts.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Each income and expense document contains a 'userId' field that must match
 *   the 'userId' in the path. This denormalization avoids the need for complex
 *   lookups and ensures that ownership can be verified directly on the document.

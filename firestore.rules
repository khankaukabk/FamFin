/**
 * This ruleset enforces a collaborative, family-centric security model for a
 * personal finance application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * Access to data is controlled at the "family" level. A user can only access
 * financial records (incomes, expenses) if they are a member of the family
 * associated with that data. All operations require user authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically. A top-level 'families' collection
 * holds documents for each family unit. Each family document then contains
 * 'incomes' and 'expenses' subcollections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Assumed Membership Field: These rules ASSUME that each document in the
 *   `/families/{familyId}` collection contains a `members` field which is an
 *   ARRAY of user UIDs. This field is CRITICAL for authorization and must be
 *   managed by the application logic. Without it, these rules will deny access.
 * - No Public Listing: Users cannot list or discover all families in the
 *   database. They can only access families they are explicitly members of.
 * - Subcollection Access via Parent: Security for subcollections (incomes,
 *   expenses) is inherited from the parent family document. Rules use a `get()`
 *   call to the parent to verify the requesting user's membership, ensuring
 *   that all data within a family's data tree is protected by a single source
 *   of truth.
 * - Relational Integrity: On creation, documents in subcollections must have a
 *   `familyId` field that correctly matches the `familyId` in their path.
 *   This field is enforced as immutable to prevent data from being moved
 *   between families.

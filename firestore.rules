/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Family Financials App
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 * @data_structure All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with subcollections for incomes and expenses. This structure ensures clear ownership and simplifies security rules.
 * @key_security_decisions User listing is disallowed.  All write operations require the user to be authenticated and to own the data being modified.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization The 'userId' field is present on all Income and Expense documents, allowing for simple ownership checks without additional reads.
 * @structural_segregation N/A - All data is private to the user.

/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Family Financials App
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data. It also allows any authenticated user to manage attendance records.
 * @data_structure All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with subcollections for incomes and expenses. Attendance data is stored in a top-level `attendanceSessions` collection.
 * @key_security_decisions User listing is disallowed. All write operations require the user to be authenticated. User data is private, but attendance data is open to any logged-in user.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization The 'userId' field is present on all Income and Expense documents, allowing for simple ownership checks without additional reads.
 * @structural_segregation User data is private, attendance data is collaborative.
